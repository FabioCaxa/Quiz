# Quiz

This is a Quiz project that I've made for Programming 1 at University of the people.

## MultipleChoiceQuestion.java

This file querry the user for a multiple choice between A, B, C, D and E. It creates buttons so the user can choose.

## Question.java

Here we have the number of questions, and number of correct answers at the end. I defined ask, check and showResults.

## QuestionDialog.java

This file implements the ActionListener that performs an action, and then dispose of the question and goes to the next one.

## Quiz.java

This is the main file, and where the questions are, it calls the check method at the end of each question.

## TrueFalseQuestion.java

This file asks the user for true and false questions and returns the answers.
